# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately using GitHub Security Advisories:

* `Security` tab -> `Advisories` -> `New draft security advisory`

Do not open a public GitHub Issue for security-sensitive reports.

## Supported Versions

We aim to fix security issues in the latest released version. Older versions may not receive backports.
